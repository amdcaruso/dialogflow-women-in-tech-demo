# Dialogflow: Women Mentor Search and Escalation to a Human 

This project consists of a simple Dialogflow agent, deployed to firebase cloud functions that shows the use of dialogflow, google cloud natural language api, sentiment analysis and firebase.

This project is designed as a demo, not as a finished solution.
